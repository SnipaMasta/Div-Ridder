# Module 1 Challenge

## Description
For this challenge, I refactored the given code to change the "divs" present to "sections" to make the code more efficient. The website, visually and functionaly, is unchanged. I built this to improve clunky, inefficient code that did not feature HTML semantic tags. The code I have written here accomplishes this goal. In doing this, I learned the importance of HTML semantic tags and writing code that is easy and pleasant to read.
